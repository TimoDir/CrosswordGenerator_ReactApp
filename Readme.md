# React App to Generate Crossword Puzzles
This is a React App designed to generate crossword puzzles with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. It provides an intuitive user experience and is highly customizable. It allows users to define the size of their puzzles, allowing them to set the difficulty level according to their own preferences. The generated puzzles can then be printed or shared with friends to play together. 

## Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies for the React App. We recommend using npm to do this. Once the dependencies are installed, you can launch the React App by running `npm start` in your project directory.

## Usage
The React App has a number of customization options, which you'll find in the sidebar menu. You can set the size of the crossword puzzle, write customize set of word you want to hide inside. There is also a preview section that shows how the finished result will look. Once you're satisfied with your settings, you can save your crossword puzzle by clicking the 'Save' button. You can then share the puzzle with friends or print it out for a paper-based experience.

## Contributing
We welcome all contributions to this project! If you have an idea for a new feature or would like to report a bug, please open an issue on our GitHub repository. 

Happy Puzzling!

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
